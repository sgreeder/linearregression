# Regression Models
In this data set, I am looking to see what variables affect how many miles per gallon a car can reach. Using different regression models to help find the best fitting model to explain the changes in miles per gallon.
The Miles per Gallon can be affected by number of cyliners, cubic inches, horsepower, weight, 0-60, year, and brand. I used Python to create Linear Regression, Cubic Regression, and Quadratic Regression. Ultimately, I found that number of cylinders and  horsepower have strong positive relationship with miles per gallon. This also looks at different models and how well they fit looking at R^2 and adjusted R^2. 
I also put the linear, quadratic, and cubic regressions into scatter plots to easier explain which model I would choose. I would choose the quadratic model (2nd Scatter Plot) as it has a higher prediction rate than other models.
